    <p class="lead m-4">I am a life long learner. I love to learn and I am currently focused on web development (full-stack to be exact). I am also learning RV repair, training, and inspections. I recently obtained my level 1 RV inpector through the <a href="https://nrvia.org/" target="_blank">NRVIA</a> (National RV Inspection Association).
